# VInstall

A minimal Android application for installing APK, XAPK, APKS, APKM, APKV, and ZIP packages, with a built-in app manager, backup, and uninstaller.

## Features

### Package Installation

Supports six package formats:

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| APK    | Standard Android package |
| XAPK   | APK with OBB expansion data or split APKs bundle |
| APKS   | Split APKs archive (SAI format) |
| APKM   | Split APKs archive (APKMirror format) |
| APKV   | Encrypted or plain split APKs archive (custom format, see [APKV spec](https://github.com/vinstall/apkv-spec/blob/main/README.md)) |
| ZIP    | Generic ZIP archive containing APK split files |

For split APK formats (XAPK, APKS, APKM, APKV, ZIP), individual splits can be selected or deselected before installation. APKV files support optional password-based encryption and integrity verification via SHA-256 checksums.

### Install Modes

Three installation modes are available:

- **Normal** — uses the standard Android package installer
- **Root** — installs silently using root access
- **Shizuku** — installs silently via the [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) service without requiring full root

### App Manager

Browse all installed user apps with the ability to:

- View app details: version, SDK range, install and update dates, APK size, data directory, split count, and requested permissions
- Launch or open the system app info page
- Export the app as an `.apkv` archive
- Uninstall the app (supports Normal, Root, and Shizuku modes)
- Compute and copy the APK hash (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256)

### Backup/Export

Export any installed user app as an `.apkv` archive directly from the App Manager or the dedicated Backup screen. Exports are created in private app storage and can then be saved with Android's document picker. Optional password-based encryption is supported when exporting.

### Android TV

The `tv` flavor is a separately installable, five-way-remote-friendly build with a Leanback dashboard. Its Receive screen starts a lifecycle-bound LAN server with a six-digit pairing code for browser uploads and authenticated APKV downloads. Received packages are always reviewed and explicitly installed on the TV.

XAPK expansion files are accepted only when Root or an active, granted Shizuku installation mode is selected. VInstall validates the APK package name and writes only `.obb` files beneath that package's protected OBB directory.

### Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Install mode | Normal, Root, or Shizuku |
| Theme | Light, Dark, or follow system |
| Confirm before install | Show a confirmation dialog before installing |
| Clear cache after install | Automatically remove temp files after installation |
| Debug window | Show or hide the in-app log viewer |
| Crash Reports |  Logs can be viewed, copied, or cleared directly from the app |

## Requirements

- Android 5.0 (API 21) or higher
- "Install unknown apps" permission granted for this app
- Root or active Shizuku access is required for XAPK packages that contain OBB data
- Root access required when using Root mode
- [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) installed and running when using Shizuku mode

## Building

### Debug

```bash
./gradlew assemblePhoneDebug
./gradlew assembleTvDebug
```

### Release

#### Using GitHub Actions (CI)

Before triggering a release build, create a keystore and configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded `.jks` keystore file |
| `STORE_PASSWORD`  | Keystore password |
| `KEY_ALIAS`       | Key alias |
| `KEY_PASSWORD`    | Key password |

Then push a tag prefixed with `v` to trigger the release workflow:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The signed release APK will be automatically attached to the corresponding GitHub Release.

#### Using a Local Keystore

Alternatively, you can build a signed release APK locally by adding the following properties to your `local.properties` file:

```properties
STORE_FILE=/absolute/path/to/your/keystore.jks
STORE_PASSWORD=your_store_password
KEY_ALIAS=your_key_alias
KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
```

Then run:

```bash
./gradlew assemblePhoneRelease
./gradlew assembleTvRelease
```

## Gradle Wrapper

The `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` file is included in the repository. However, if you want to generate the file again, just type:

```bash
gradle wrapper --gradle-version=9.4.1
```

## APKV Format

VInstall introduces **APKV**, a custom container format for archiving and distributing Android application packages. It supports plain and password-encrypted payloads, embeds an application icon, includes integrity checksums per APK file, and includes a structured JSON manifest. The full specification is available in the [APKV spec](https://github.com/vinstall/apkv-spec/blob/main/README.md) and [apkv-cli](https://github.com/vinstall/apkv-cli).
